Setting this option will mean that while the build is in progress, that no one
is allowed to add files to the source stream or project. This will ensure that
the project and build area are consistent until the build has been completed.

Once the build is finished, the project will be automatically unlocked.

This option must be used if you wish to <i>tag</i> a successful build.
