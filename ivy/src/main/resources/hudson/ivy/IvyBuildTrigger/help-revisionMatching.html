    Select this checkbox if you want to allow the optional <i>trunk</i> and <i>revision</i> attributes
    of the ivy.xml module descriptor to help identify upstream project dependencies within Hudson.
    Leaving this option unchecked means that only the mandatory <i>organisation</i> and <i>module</i> 
    attributes will be used when matching against project module descriptors.  However it also means
    that if you have two or more projects configured in Hudson using the same mandatory attribute
    values in their module descriptors, and this project defines a dynamic revision dependency on one of the
    modules, then all those projects will match and will be considered upstream dependencies.  This is usually
    <b>not</b> what you want if you are using Hudson CI to build different versions (or different
    source code branches) of the same module at the same time.
