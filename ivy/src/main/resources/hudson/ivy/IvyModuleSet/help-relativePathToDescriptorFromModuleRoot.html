  <p>
  The relative path to the module descriptor file from the root of
  each module.
  
  <p>
  Given a module "moduleX" with an ivy descriptor located at
  "moduleX/ivy/ivy.xml" you should enter "ivy/ivy.xml" here.
  Given a module "moduleY" with an ivy descriptor located at
  "moduleY/build/ivy.xml" you should enter "build/ivy.xml" here.
  
  <p>
  If some of your modules have their ivy descriptors in different
  places then enter the most common value here.  After your first
  build you will need to edit the configuration of all the other
  modules to override this default value.
  
  <p>
  Leave blank to use the default of "ivy.xml" (assumes your ivy.xml
  file is located directly in the root of each module).
