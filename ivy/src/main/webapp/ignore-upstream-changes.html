  If checked, Hudson will parse the Ivy descriptor files of this project, and see if any of its
  dependencies are built on this Hudson as well. If so, Hudson will set up build dependency relationship
  so that whenever the dependency job is built, Hudson will schedule a build of this project.

  This is convenient for automatically performing continuous integration.

  If this behaviour is problematic, uncheck this option.
