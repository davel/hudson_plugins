  If checked, Hudson will only build modules with changes from SCM, any
  modules which depend on those changed modules, and any modules that
  failed to build successfully in the previous build. If the SCM reports
  no changes to any modules then all modules will be built.

  <p>
  This functionality currently only works if the "Build modules as separate jobs"
  option is selected.
