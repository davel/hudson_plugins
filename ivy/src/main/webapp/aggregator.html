  <p>
  If checked, Hudson will run individual module builds as separate builds. On a project
  with a large number of modules, or on a project where modules take a long time to build,
  setting this option to true may speed up the whole build, as different modules can be built
  in parallel.
  
  <p>
  In this case the specified ant targets will be called on each module separately.  Also, all
  of the post-build actions will be run per-module and the paths you specify in their
  configuration should be relative to the root directory of each individual module.
  
  <p>
  Otherwise, leave it unchecked and Hudson will build this Ivy project like you'd normally
  do from command line.
