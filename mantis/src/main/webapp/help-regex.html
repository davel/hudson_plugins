This is alternative to "Issue id pattern". Unlike it, This pattern is regular expressions,
which is used to match issue IDs in SCM changeset comments.
<p>
If empty, "Issue id pattern" is used.
<p>
For example, if you enter "(?i)(?:mantis|issue|case|bug)\s*[:#.]?\s*(\d+)", you can use following changeset comments.
<ul>
    <li>mantis: 123</li>
    <li>ISSUE 456</li>
    <li>case#789</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note:
<ul>
    <li>"(\d+)" means Mantis issue id, so regular expressions have to contain it.</li>
    <li>If you use "Logical OR", you have to use "non-caputuring group" such as "(<b>?:</b>X|Y)".</li>
</ul>
