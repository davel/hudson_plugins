  Add project-specific pairs of patterns and URLs - will turn occurences of pattern in changelog text into links to paired URL, replacing $1, $2, etc with matched groups. Note - backslashes in patterns do not need to be escaped. Global pattern/URL pairs will still be used, unless a global pattern is overridden here.
