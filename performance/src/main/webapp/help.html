<div>This plugin understands the <a
	href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a> analysis report XML
format and the <a href="http://www.soapui.org/"> SOAPUI report in
JUnit format</a>. This plug-in does not perform the actual analysis; it only
displays useful information about analysis results, such as average
responding time, historical result trend, web UI for viewing analysis
reports, and so on.

<p>To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then
specify the path to the different Performance XML file, such as <tt>jmeter-results.jtl</tt>,
or to the repositories which contain this different files.</p>
