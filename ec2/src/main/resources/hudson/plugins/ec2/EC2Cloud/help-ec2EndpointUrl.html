<div>
    This field is optional. It controls what EC2 API endpoint to connect to. 
    By default https://us-east-1.ec2.amazonaws.com/ is used. To use other 
    Amazon AWS zones, change this appropriately.
    
    When using Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (Eucalyptus) a url like
    http://cluster-controler:8773/services/Eucalyptus is needed.

    For other EC2 API-compatible clouds please see your product documentation.
