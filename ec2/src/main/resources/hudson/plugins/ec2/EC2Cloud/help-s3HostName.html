<div>
    This field is optional. It controls what S3 API endpoint to connect to. If
    a dotted hostname is provided that host is used. If no hostname is
    provided, s3.amazonaws.com is used (note that this works with all amazonaws
    EC2 zones - s3 transparently redirects between zones. Finally if a non-dotted
    hostname is provided, .amazonaws.com is appended to the hostname (to permit
    the easy use of region specific amazon S3 endpoints if desired). See the
    <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/index.html?RequestEndpoints.html">S3 docs</a>
    for more details.
