<div>
    This field is optional. It controls whether to use a secure connection to
    the EC2 API web service. Using an insecure connection means that your
    control requests could be monitored. The API itself provides for protection
    against replay attacks: your credentials will be safe even if you choose an
    unsecured connection. A secure connection is recommended. However, if you
    are using Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (Eucalyptus) the
    default configuration only uses SSL for the web admin interface, the API
    port (8773) is unsecured and this checkbox should be off.
