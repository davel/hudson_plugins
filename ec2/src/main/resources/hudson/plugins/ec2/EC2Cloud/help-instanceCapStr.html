    You can place the upward limit to the number of EC2 instances that Hudson may launch.
    This is useful for avoiding surprises in the billing statement.

    <P>
    For example, if this field is 3, Hudson will only launch at most 3 EC2 instances,
    even if it noticed that the demand is much higher. Leave this field empty to remove a cap
    (note that EC2 appears to have its own instance cap.)
