<div>
    This field is optional. It controls what usercode to ssh into instances
    to perform administration. Many EC2 AMI's ship with root as the administrative
    user, but official Ubuntu images ship with root disabled and the user
    'ubuntu' available instead. If the user does not have direct administrative
    access you may also want to set the root command prefix. Hudson will use these
    two fields to make the root user usable again.
