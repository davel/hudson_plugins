<div>
    Defines a simple text parameter, where users can enter a string value,
    which you can use during a build, either as an environment variable, or
    through variable substitution in some other parts of the configuration.
    <p/>
    Additionally, this parameter supports a regular expression based validation
    of the user entered parameter to ensure it meets the build's requirements.
