    	If checked, all calls to the AccuRev CLI on a particular node will be 
    	synchronized. That is to say, only one CLI operation can be going on at 
    	any time, across all jobs on a given node. The default is synchronized,
    	which is the plugin's original behavior.
    	<br /><br />
    	This sync was supposedly for problems with older versions of the AccuRev
    	CLI. If you have a recent version of AccuRev (4.7+, possibly earlier), 
    	it should be ok to turn off synchronization. This can speed up operations
    	significantly in some scenarios, such as with multiple jobs with large 
    	checkouts.
