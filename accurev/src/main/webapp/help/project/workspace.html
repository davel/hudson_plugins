    <p>
        By default, this plugin checks out the latest changes without using a workspace. This removes the need to
        manually create a workspace for each project, and removes the need for the plugin to make Accurev transactions
        while moving the workspace from slave to slave as the build migrates from slave to slave.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, there may be situations when the use of a workspace is preferred. If you want to use a workspace
        select this checkbox. You will need to manually create the workspace for this job. The plugin can manage
        migrating the workspace to the appropriate build machine and relocating the workspace to use the correct parent
        stream (i.e. it knows how to do <code>accurev chws</code>) but the side-effect is that these changes will be
        recorded in the Accurev repository.
    </p>

    <p>When not using a workspace, the following Accurev commands will be used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>accurev pop -R</code> to extract all the files. Note: this command will not work either if the
            directory that the files are being extracted to is the child of an active Accurev Workspace.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When using a workspace, the following Accurev commands will be used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>accurev show wspaces</code> to validate that the workspace is valid and has the correct parent stream
        </li>
        <li><i>(Optional)</i> <code>accurev chws</code> if the workspace: is in the wrong directory; on the wrong
            machine; or has the wrong parent stream.
        </li>
        <li><code>accurev update</code> to update the workspace.</li>
        <li><code>accurev pop -R</code> to ensure that all files are populated.</li>
    </ul>
