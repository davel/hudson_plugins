    <p>
    	When toggled, Hudson will create a snapshot of the target stream, then populate and build from that snapshot.
    </p>
    <p>
    <u>Known Limitations:</u>
    	<ul>
	    <li>Currently this feature does not work with the "Use workspace" option.</li> 
	    <li>The naming convention of the snapshot is limited to: "<i>hudson_job_name</i>"_"<i>build_number</i>".</li>
	    <li>If the snapshot name already exists, the accurev mksnap command will fail and the build will stop.</li>
    	</ul>
    </p>
