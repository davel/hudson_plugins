        Some projects do not need to checkout the entire workspace as they only use a portion of the workspace.
        For example, when accessing a large remote repository to build a sub-module.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you specify a sub-path "best-effort" will be made to ensure that only that sub-path is populated.
        Best-effort means that at least the files within the sub-path will be fetched, but side-effects may result in
        files from other paths being fetched as well:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The changelog does not currently filter by sub-path. Thus, any change in the repository will trigger a
            build
        </li>
        <li>
            When using a workspace, it is necessary to update the workspace, this will populate any changed files, not
            just the ones in the sub-path. The subsequent populate will ensure that at least all the files within the
            sub-path are fetched.
        </li>
    </ul>
