    Hudson understands <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html">PMD's Copy Paste Detector (CPD)</a>
    analysis report XML format. When this option is configured you need to set up your build
	to run CPD in order to use this feature! This plug-in does not perform the actual analysis;
	it only displays useful information about analysis results, such as historical result trend,
	module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis reports and
	warnings, and so on.
