    Hudson understands <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a> analysis report XML format.
    When this option is configured you need to set up your build
	to run PMD in order to use this feature! This plug-in does not perform the actual analysis;
	it only displays useful information about analysis results, such as historical result trend,
	module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis reports and
	warnings, and so on.
  </p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> If you are using the maven-pmd-plugin to create the PMD analysis files please
   make sure to specify the pattern <code>**/target/pmd.xml</code>. Otherwise
   you will get a wrong warning count since the maven-pmd-plugin gererates
   two identical output files.
