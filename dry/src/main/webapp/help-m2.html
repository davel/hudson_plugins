    Hudson understands <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html">PMD's Copy Paste Detector (CPD)</a>
    analysis report XML format.
	When this option is configured and your build runs the
	maven goal <code>pmd:cpd</code> then Hudson provides useful
	information about analysis results, such as historical result trend,
	module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis reports and
	warnings, and so on.
