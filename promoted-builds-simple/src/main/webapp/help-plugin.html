<div>
  Select the promotion level for a build on the build status page.
  "Update Run" permission on the project is required to promote a build.
  The promotion level is shown on the build status page and the icon image
  is shown in the Build History on the project status page.
  <p/>
  The promotion level and a numeric index value from the list above are made
  available in the remote API, so queries may be done for particular promotion
  levels.  Example: <br/>
  <tt>http://my-hudson/job/MyJob/api/xml?xpath=*/build[action/levelValue&gt;=2][1]</tt><br/>
  This query finds the latest build promoted to the second or higher level.
  <p/>
  All builds run after this plugin is installed will be promotable.  To enable the
  promotion control for an older build first use this magic URL: <br/>
  <tt>http://my-hudson/job/MyJob/{build#}/parent/parent/plugin/promoted-builds-simple/makePromotable</tt>
