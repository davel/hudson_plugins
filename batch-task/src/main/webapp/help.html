  This feature allows you to associate shell scripts that perform some
  tasks on Hudson that are manually triggered occasionally (for example,
  performing a release, doing copyright header check, integrating newer versions
  of library jars to CVS, etc.)
  
  This allows your team to run lengthy and/or recurring tasks on Hudson asynchronously.
  It also allows people outside your team to trigger the tasks, thereby
  preventing the common <i>"we need to do XYZ but only Kohsuke knows how to do this
  and he's on vacation!"</i> problem.
