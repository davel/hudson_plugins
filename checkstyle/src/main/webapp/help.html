    Hudson understands <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a> analysis report XML format.
    When this option is configured you need to set up your build
	to run Checkstyle in order to use this feature! This plug-in does not perform the actual analysis;
	it only displays useful information about analysis results, such as historical result trend,
	module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis reports and
	warnings, and so on.
