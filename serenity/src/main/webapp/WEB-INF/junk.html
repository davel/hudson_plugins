Serenity runs as a JavaAgent, as such the byte code is modified in memory.<br />
<b>Configuration of Serenity for an Ant build:</b><br />
To enable the JavaAgent the Ant build script needs to be modified to include the agent as in the following:<br />
&lt;jvmarg line="-javaagent:serenity/serenity.jar" /&gt;<br />
The JUnit task needs to be in forked mode, and typically with the option 'once'. Starting a new JVM for every test will 
be very time consuming.<br />
The serenity.jar needs to then be in the directory directly beneath the working directory of the build.xml. In all cases 
serenity.jar needs to be in the serenity folder at the root of the project, this is the working folder of serenity, where the 
database file will be written, and where the log and modified classes are written if specified.<br />
System properties that are available and can be set are:<br />
1) included.packages - the package names that are to be collected, semi-colon separated list(mandatory)<br />
2) included.adapters - the class adapters that will generate the collection data for the classes, semi-colon separated list(mandatory)<br />
3) write.classes - whether the modified classes are to be written to the file system for later inspection, true or false(optional)<br />
4) clean.classes -whether to delete the old written classes before writing the new ones, true or false(optional)<br />
