    When this option is configured, Hudson can transform test result report produced by different testing tools into JUnit test result.
    Then JUnit tests can be recorded by Hudson. Hudson can provide useful information about test results,
    such as historical test result trend, web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures, and so on.
