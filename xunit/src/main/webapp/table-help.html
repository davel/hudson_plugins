    setting that specifies the generated raw XML or others (depends on testing tool) report files,
    such as '**/build/cppunit-reports/*.xml'.
    Basedir of the fileset is relative to the module root unless you have configured
    your SCM with multiple modules, in which case it is relative to
    <a href='ws/'>the workspace root</a>.  Note that the module root is SCM-specific, and may
    not be the same as the workspace root.
