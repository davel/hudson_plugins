    Automatically authenticate every user by using their IP addresses.
    For example, you can use this on your publicly visible Hudson instance
    to allow the administrator permission to anyone accessing from localhost.

    <p>
    In this way, your server only need one authentication mechanism (like publickey-based ssh),
    and people can administer Hudson by doing port forwarding like
    <tt>ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 kohsuke@server</tt> from anywhere and then
    accessing <tt>localhost:8080</tt> in the browser (this connection goes through
    the SSH tunnel, and Hudson on port 80 will see inbound connection from localhost.)
