  When checked, Hudson will subscribe to the change notification e-mail
  from java.net and trigger a new build every time a change is made in
  the repository.

  As opposed to the polling mode, which adds the additional load to the server,
  this method is much more friendly to the CVS server, and therefore this is
  the recommended mode of configuring the automatic trigger.

  <p>
  Note that the subscription/unsubscription is performed asynchronously,
  so it may take up to a few minutes before this change takes effect.
