<div>
    For projects that need to use RAD's headless capabilities (or, even better,
    BU) as the build system. This causes Hudson to invoke RAD/BU with the given
    targets and options. Any non-zero exit code causes Hudson to mark the build
    as a failure.
    <br/>
    Hudson supplies some <a href="/env-vars.html">environment variables</a> that
    can be used from within the build script.
    <br/>
    To know more about RAD's headless features, please refer to the
    <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/radhelp/v7r0m0/topic/com.ibm.etools.ant.tasks.doc/topics/tjant.html">RAD 7.0 Infocenter</a>
