<div>
    Set this option if you want to get an equivalent of Hudson's <code>WORKSPACE
    </code> environment variable through the <code>PROJECT_WORKSPACE</code> one.
    <br/>
    Wether you set this option or not, be sure to never use the <code>WORKSPACE
    </code> variable during this build step as it doesn't refer to the workspace
    of the project: It is internally used by RAD.
