<p>
 If you check this option, Hudson will retain gnathtml result for each successful build. 
 This allows you to browser gnathtml results for older builds, at the expense of additional disk space requirement.

 If you leave this option unchecked, Hudson will only keep the latest gnathtml, so older doxygen HTML will be overwritten as new builds succeed.
