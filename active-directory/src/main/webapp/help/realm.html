  With this option, Hudson authenticates the username and the password through Active Directory.
  For this to work, Hudson must be running on a Windows machine that belongs to the domain.
  (To run Hudson on a Unix system and have it authenticate against Active Directory, use LDAP.)

  <p>
  Hudson recognizes all the groups in Active Directory that the user belongs to, so you can
  use those to make authorization decisions (for example, you can choose the matrix-based
  security as the authorization strategy and perhaps allow "Domain Admins" to administer
  Hudson.)
