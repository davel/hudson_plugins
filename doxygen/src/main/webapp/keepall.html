 If you check this option, Hudson will retain doxygen HTML result for each successful build. 
 This allows you to browser doxygen for older builds, at the expense of additional disk space requirement.

 If you leave this option unchecked, Hudson will only keep the latest doxygen HTML, so older doxygen HTML will be overwritten as new builds succeed.
