<div>
    Accepts a file submission from a browser as a build parameter.
    The uploaded file will be placed at the specified location in the workspace,
    which your build can then access and use.

    <p>
    This is useful for many situations, such as:

    <ol>
    <li>Letting people run tests on the artifacts they built.
    <li>Automating the upload/release/deployment process by allowing the user to place the file.
    <li>Perform data processing by uploading a dataset.
    </ol>
