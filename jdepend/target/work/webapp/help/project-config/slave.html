  Sometimes a project can only be successfully built on a particular slave
  (or master).  If so, this option forces Hudson to always build this project
  on a specific computer.

  Otherwise, uncheck the box so that Hudson can schedule builds on available
  nodes, which results in faster turn-around time.

  <p>
  This option is also useful when you'd like to make sure that a project can
  be built on a particular node.
