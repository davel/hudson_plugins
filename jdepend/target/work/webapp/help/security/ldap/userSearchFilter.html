    One of the searches Hudson does on LDAP is to locate the user record given the user name.

    <p>
    This field determines the query to be run to identify the user record. The query is
    almost always <tt>"uid={0}"</tt> as per defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2798.txt">RFC 2798</a>,
    so in most cases you should leave this field empty and let this default kick in.

    <p>
    If you do specify a different query, specify an LDAP query string with marker token "{0}",
    which is to be replaced by the user name string entered by the user.
