    One of the searches Hudson does on LDAP is to locate the list of groups for a user.

    <p/>
    This field determines the query to be run to identify the organizational unit that
    contains groups. The query is almost always <tt>"ou=groups"</tt> so try that first,
    though this field may be left blank to search from the root DN.
