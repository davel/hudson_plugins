  <p>
    When you run jobs that require TCP/IP ports (such as for testing purpose) in a machine
    with multiple executors, multiple jobs that just so happen to run at the same time
    may interfere with each other by using the same TCP/IP port.
  <p>
    You can avoid such a conflict by manually assining unique TCP/IP ports to every job on Hudson,
    but that will quickly get very tedious.

    This feature solves this problem by letting Hudson do the bookkeeping and allocate
    unique port numbers.
  <p>
    To use this feature, put a comma-separated list of the names of environment variables
    (such as "<tt>HTTP_PORT,ADMIN_PORT,SHUTDOWN_PORT</tt>".) Before the build starts,
    Hudson will allocate unique ports and set them as environment variables.
  <p>
    This feature also allows jobs to require a certain fixed port. For example, if your job
    is testing a mail server, where you'd require port 25 and no other ports would do,
    then simply add <tt>25</tt> to the list, so that Hudson can make sure that no two
    jobs that require the same port will run on the same node concurrently.
