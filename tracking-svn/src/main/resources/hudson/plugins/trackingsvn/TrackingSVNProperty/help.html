<p>
If enabled, the Subversion revisions that are checked out for this project will track the revisions in another project.
</p>
<p>
The Subversion configuration must still be entered. More than one module may be used, and the revision tracking will happen 
for any URL in this project that exactly matches the tracked project. For all other modules, the latest revision will be used. 
</p>  
<p>
When building, the TRACKING_SVN_BUILD environment variable will contain the URL of the tracked build.
</p>
<p>
It is generally useless to use SCM polling if SVN tracking is enabled. Instead, trigger this project from the tracked project.
