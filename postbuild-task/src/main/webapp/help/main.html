<p> This feature allows you to associate shell or a batch scripts that perform some tasks on Hudson depending on the build log output.If the log text matches some where in the build log file, the script will execute.
ex: if "IOException" if specified in the log text, and if the build log file contains the string "IOException", the script will execute.  
</p>
<p> Java Regex are allowed, and groups can be used as script parameters. If the text is "Last Build : #(\d+)" and the script is "script.sh %1", then if the log contains a line "Last Build : #4", the script will be called as "script.sh 4".
