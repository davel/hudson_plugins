    Hudson can scan the files in your source and resource folders for open tasks,
    like TODO or FIXME markers or @deprecated tags. When this option is configured,
    Hudson can provide useful information about open tasks,
    such as historical result trend, web UI for viewing the tasks, and so on. Note that
    no special maven goal is required to activate this plug-in, it is automatically
    called after the first maven goal has been finished.
