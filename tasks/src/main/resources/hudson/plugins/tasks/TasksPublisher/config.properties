description.files=<a href='http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/fileset.html'>Fileset 'includes'</a> \
             	  setting that specifies the workspace files to scan for tasks, such as '**/*.java'. \
             	  Basedir of the fileset is <a href='ws/'>the workspace root</a>. \
             	  If no value is set, then the default '**/*.java' is used.
description.tags=Configure the tags identifiers that should be looked for in the workspace files. \
             	 For each priority a comma separated list of tags could be defined, e.g. TODO, FIXME, etc.
description.threshold=If the number of open tasks exceeds this threshold then a build is \
           			  considered as unstable. Leave this field empty if the unstable state of the build \
           			  should not be touched by this plug-in.
description.healthy=Configure health reporting thresholds. If the actual number of open tasks is between \
             		the provided thresholds, then the healthiness is interpolated.
description.height=Height of the trend report image (in pixels). Leave this field empty to use the default height.
