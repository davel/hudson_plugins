    Files will be uploaded relative to this path.
    For example, if your path is "/my/path", and this is the first build,
    the files will be uploaded at:
    https://mgr.cubit.example.com/pbl/project_name/priv/my/path/.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may include environmental variables, referred to by ${ENV_VAR_NAME}, 
    that will be 
    interpreted at runtime in this field.  For example, your path could be 
    "/my/path/${BUILD_ID}" or "/my/path/build_${BUILD_NUMBER}".<br>
    See <a href='/env-vars.html' target=_new>the list of available environment variables</a>.<br>
    It is wise to include a build-specific environmental variable in your
    path if you intend to set the force option to false.
  </p>
  <p>
    If "Preserve Local Directory Structure" is chosen, the directory structure 
    from the workspace will be preserved
    after upload.  So if your file pattern is "upload_stuff/sub_folder/my_file.txt", 
    the file will end
    up at:<br>
    https://mgr.cubit.example.com/pbl/project_name/priv/my/path/upload_stuff/sub_folder/my_file.txt<br>
    If "Do Not Preserve..." is chosen, the file would end up at:<br>
    https://mgr.cubit.example.com/pbl/project_name/priv/my/path/my_file.txt
  </p>
