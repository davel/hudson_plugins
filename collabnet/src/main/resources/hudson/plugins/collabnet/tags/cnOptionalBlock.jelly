    Foldable block that can be expanded to show more controls by checking the checkbox.  This is based on the optionBlock.jelly from the Hudson project, but extends it to allow onclick events to be set.

    <st:attribute name="name" use="required">
      Name of the checkbox. Can be used by the server to determine
      if the block is collapsed or expanded at the time of submission.

      Note that when the block is collapsed, none of its child controls will send
      the values to the server (unlike &lt;f:advanced>)
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="title" use="required">
      Human readable text that follows the checkbox.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="checked" use="required">
      initial checkbox status. true/false.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="help">
      If present, the (?) icon will be rendered on the right to show inline help.
      See @help for &lt;f:entry>.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="negative">
      if present, the foldable section expands when the checkbox is unchecked.
    </st:attribute>
    <st:attribute name="onclick">
      What should happen when the checkbox is clicked.
    </st:attribute>
