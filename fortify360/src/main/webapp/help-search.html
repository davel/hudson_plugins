    The build will be considered as <u>UNSTABLE</u> if the fail condition is match.  
    <p>E.g. to fail if there is any SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting in Hot Folder, use the following search string</p>
    <p>[fortify priority order]:high category:/SQL Injection|Cross-Site Scripting/</p>
    <p>This search string syntax is the same as the AWB search/filter</p>
