    This script is executed as root at the end of the installation (but before the system reboot),
    inside the newly installed file system.

    <p>
    While the installer is running, the output from this command can be seen by pressing
    <tt>Ctrl+Alt+F4</tt>. It is also captured as <tt>/lateCommand.out</tt>, so that you can
    see it after the installation is completed.
