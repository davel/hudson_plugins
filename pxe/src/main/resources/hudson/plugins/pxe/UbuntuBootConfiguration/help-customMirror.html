    By default, slaves will download all the packages from Hudson (served from the ISO file you confiured.)
    This is normally the fastest local mirror.
    If you have manually set up other mirror sites and prefer to use that instead, specify its URL,
    like "http://myserver/ubuntu". Otherwise, leave it empty.
