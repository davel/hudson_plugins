# Preseed file
#
# Debian (from which Ubuntu is derived) uses the technology called preseeding to
# automate installations. This is basically just providing answers to questions
# that the installer asks. Each installer question has an implicit ID and the type,
# and this file consists of lines like "d-i <ID> <TYPE> <ANSWER>".
#
# On top of the standard preseeding format, this resource will be processed by
# Hudson by expanding ${prop} as a property ofthe UbuntuBootConfiguration object.
# This mechanism pulls in user-specified configuration into the preseeding.

### Localization
# Locale sets language and country.
d-i debian-installer/locale string en_US

# Keyboard selection.
#d-i console-tools/archs select at
d-i console-keymaps-at/keymap select us

### Network configuration
# netcfg will choose an interface that has link if possible. This makes it
# skip displaying a list if there is more than one interface.
d-i netcfg/choose_interface select auto

# Any hostname and domain names assigned from dhcp take precedence over
# values set here. However, setting the values still prevents the questions
# from being shown, even if values come from dhcp.
d-i netcfg/get_hostname string unassigned-hostname
d-i netcfg/get_domain string unassigned-domain

### Mirror settings
# If you select ftp, the mirror/country string does not need to be set.
#d-i mirror/protocol string ftp
d-i mirror/country string enter information manually
d-i mirror/http/hostname string ${mirrorHostName}
d-i mirror/http/directory string ${mirrorDirectory}
d-i mirror/http/proxy string

### Partitioning

# Alternatively, you can specify a disk to partition. The device name
# can be given in either devfs or traditional non-devfs format.
# For example, to use the first disk:
#d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/discs/disc0/disc
d-i partman-auto/disk string /dev/sda
# In addition, you'll need to specify the method to use.
# The presently available methods are: "regular", "lvm" and "crypto"
d-i partman-auto/method string regular
# If one of the disks that are going to be automatically partitioned
# contains an old LVM configuration, the user will normally receive a
# warning. This can be preseeded away...
d-i partman-auto/purge_lvm_from_device boolean true
# And the same goes for the confirmation to write the lvm partitions.
d-i partman-lvm/confirm boolean true
# This will create one partition for everything, plus a small swap space
# d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select All files in one partition (recommended for new users)
# This is my attempt to create a bigger swap partition
d-i partman-auto/expert_recipe string \
  boot-root :: \
    500 10000 1000000000 ext3 \
      method{ format } format{ } \
      use_filesystem{ } filesystem{ ext3 } \
      mountpoint{ / } \
    . \
    5120 0 5120 linux-swap \
      method{ swap } format{ } \
    .

# This makes partman automatically partition without confirmation.
d-i partman/confirm_write_new_label boolean true
d-i partman/choose_partition select Finish partitioning and write changes to disk
d-i partman/confirm boolean true

### Clock and time zone setup
# Controls whether or not the hardware clock is set to UTC.
d-i clock-setup/utc boolean true

# You may set this to any valid setting for $TZ; see the contents of
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ for valid values.
d-i time/zone string ${timeZone}

### Apt setup
# You can choose to install non-free and contrib software.
d-i apt-setup/multiverse boolean true
d-i apt-setup/universe boolean true

### User account
# To create a normal user account.
d-i passwd/user-fullname string ${userName}
d-i passwd/username string ${userName}
# Normal user's password
d-i passwd/user-password-crypted password ${password}
# even if the password is weak, that's OK
d-i user-setup/allow-password-weak true
# This is fairly safe to set, it makes grub install automatically to the MBR
# if no other operating system is detected on the machine.
d-i grub-installer/only_debian boolean true
# This one makes grub-installer install to the MBR if it also finds some other
# OS, which is less safe as it might not be able to boot that other OS.
d-i grub-installer/with_other_os boolean true
# allow root logon with the same password
d-i passwd/root-login boolean true
d-i passwd/root-password-crypted password ${password}

### Misc
# no private encrypted directory.
d-i user-setup/encrypted-private boolean false
# starting Ubutn 9.04 they changed the name from encrypted-private to encrypted-home
d-i user-setup/encrypted-home boolean false
# testing the late command feature. Useful for post installation
# TODO: consider using in-target script.
d-i preseed/late-command string echo late-command > /target/late-command

### Package selection
tasksel tasksel/first multiselect standard, gnome-desktop
# Individual additional packages to install
d-i pkgsel/include string openssh-server ${additionalPackages}
# Automatic security updates
d-i pkgsel/update-policy select unattended-upgrades

### Finishing up the first stage install
# Avoid that last message about the install being complete.
d-i finish-install/reboot_in_progress note
