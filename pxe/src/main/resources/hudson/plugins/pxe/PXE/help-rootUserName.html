    PXE boot support for slaves require Hudson to listen to UDP port 67 (DHCP) and 69 (TFTP).
    On Unix process, doing this requires the root access to the system, hence you need to give
    us the root username and password.

    <ul>
        <li>
        If you already run Hudson as root, this field shall be left empty.
        <li>
        If the user that Hudson currently runs already has sufficient priviledges to open such UDP ports,
        this field shall be left empty. 
        <li>
        If your current user can
        <a href="http://linux-tips.org/article/18/passwordless-sudo-setup">"sudo" without password</a> or
        <a href="http://developers.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/opensolaris/pfexec.html">"pfexec"</a>
        into root, this field shall be left empty.
        <li>
        If your system has another user that acts as root, specify that user name.
        Otherwise put "root" here.
