    If this option is set, this service will respond to all the network boot requests that's seen on the current network.
    This requires less administration overhead, but if you have other network boot services on the network, Hudson
    will interfere with them.

    <p>
    In such a situation, de-select this option, to make Hudson selectively respond to network boot requests.
    Once this option is de-selected, Hudson will record all
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">the MAC addresses</a> of hosts that are requesting network boots,
    and an administrator has to explicitly approve those MAC addresses before Hudson starts responding to them.

    <p>
    In this way, each network booted machine has to be manually approved, but you can have multiple network boot
    services that co-exist.
