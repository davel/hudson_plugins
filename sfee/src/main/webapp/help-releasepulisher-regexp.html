    The regular expression will be applied to build log and 
    result will be applied to release name.
    
    Eg.     
    If in the build log there is string like

    MyProject Revision: MP-1-0.0
    
    and regexp is:
    .*MyProject Revision: ([^\\s]*)
    
    and Release Name is:
    
    \1
    
    The resulting Release Name will be:
    MP-1-0.0
