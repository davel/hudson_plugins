    Hudson can transform test report XML format from testing tools to JUnit XML format. Then JUnit tests can be recorded
    by Hudson. When this option is configured, Hudson can provide useful information about test results, 
    such as historical test result trend, web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures, and so on.
