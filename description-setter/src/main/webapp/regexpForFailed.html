  If configured, the regexp will be applied to each line in the build log. If it matches,
  the first group is used as description for the build. This regexp is applied only for failures, 
  if it is not set then main regexp is used.

 For Maven releases, you can use this regexp: <pre>\[INFO\] Uploading project information for [^\s]* ([^\s]*)</pre>
