Short term tasks:

- Add logging.
- Enhance robustness concerning user-input.
- Add ReconnectManager to better handle communication errors.
- Provide help-html fragments for the GUI
- Code cleanups
- Add URL to build that caused the notification (help needed in order not to replicate same info in different plugins).

TODO
