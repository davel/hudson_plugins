Current ToDos
=============
- update to Smack 3.x (Note: on hold until Smack 3.x supports legacy SSL http://www.igniterealtime.org/issues/browse/SMACK-274)
- add support for aliases in bot commands
- chat modes for Bot (e.g. chatty, praising, grumpy, ...)
- changes plugin settings via bot commands
- add listener for other user leaving 1-on-1 chat (and discard that Chat object then!)


Old ToDos (from before 2007/04/24). TODO: clean these up!
=========================================================
Short term tasks:

- Add logging.
- Enhance robustness concerning user-input.
- Add ReconnectManager to better handle communication errors.
- Provide help-html fragments for the GUI
- Code cleanups
- Add URL to build that caused the notification (help needed in order not to replicate same info in different plugins).

TODO

- Connect to IRC-Plugin Author to maybe join efforts
