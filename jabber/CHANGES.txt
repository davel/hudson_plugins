Bot:
- status command can show all jobs for a view (-v <view>)
- new 'health' command
- botsnack command massively improved ;-)
- bot now also works in single-user chat [HUDSON-4057]

General:
- reconnection thread to automatically reconnect
- new notification strategy: "fails and fixes"
- default suffix for Jabber IDs. When entered Jabber IDs can be inferred from Hudson user ids
I.e. Jabber ID = <hudson_id><extension> [HUDSON-1527]
- lots of refactorings and code clean up
