<p>The start delay is a number in seconds and can be configured if you have more than one
execution definition to execute. The second and following execution
definition will be started with the specified delay.<br />
This can be helpful if you need to minimize the workload on the test environment at
startup (e.g. starting a virtual machine or install the AUT).<br/>
<b>Note:</b> If you cannot execute the executions in parallel it is better to add a new build trigger.
