<p>The start delay is a number in seconds and can be configured if you have more than one
execution definition to execute. The second and following execution
definitions will be started cascaded with the specified delay.<br />
This can be helpful if you need to minimize the workload on the test environment at
startup (e.g. starting a virtual machine or install the AUT).<br/>
<b>Note:</b> If you cannot execute the executions in parallel it recommended to add a new build trigger.
