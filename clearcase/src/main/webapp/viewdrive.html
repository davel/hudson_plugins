	Every dynamic view on a host is displayed as a subdirectory of the host's view root 
	directory. On computers running Linux or the UNIX system, the default view root 
	directory is /view. On Windows computers, the default view root directory is \\view,
	which is mapped by default to drive M.	 
  </p>
  <p> 
  	The absolute path to the ClearCase view is available as an environment 
  	variable named <code>CLEARCASE_VIEWPATH</code>.
