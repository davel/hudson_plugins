	The plugin will create a view in the workspace with the specified view name. The view is a normal folder
	which can be accessed by the build tools. Make sure that there is no other folder in the workspace 
	with the same name as the specified view name. 
	</p>
	<p>
	If you have several jobs that uses this ClearCase plugin you need to specify a unique view 
	name for each job. To help creating unique view names, there are two macros that will be 
	replaced in the view name.
	<ol>
		<li><tt>${JOB_NAME}</tt> is replaced with the name of the job</li>
		<li><tt>${USER_NAME}</tt> is replaced with the name of the user that is running Hudson</li>
	</ol>
  </p>
  <p>
  	The name of the view is available as an environment variable named <code>CLEARCASE_VIEWNAME</code>.
  	<br/> 
  	The absolute path to the ClearCase view is available as an environment 
  	variable named <code>CLEARCASE_VIEWPATH</code>.
