	If set, Hudson will only get the element version history for the specified branch. If 
	left empty then Hudson will get element version history for all branches. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple branches can be specified by separating them by a whitespace. If one branch name 
    contains whitespace, you can escape by writing the space as '\ '. For example "foo\ bar zot" 
    will specify two branches named "foo bar" and "zot".
