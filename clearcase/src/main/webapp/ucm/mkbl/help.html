	ClearCase UCM Make baseline will create a baseline for <b>every</b> build. The name of the baseline will be derived
	from the <i>name pattern</i> below (might not be that name exactly since Clearcase might use template for naming baselines).
	An environment variable, ${CC_BASELINE_NAME}, is created containing the actual name of the created baseline and is available during build.
	If the build is succesful, the baseline will be promoted to <b>BUILT</b>. The recommend option will also recommend the baseline
	for <b>REBASE</b>.
