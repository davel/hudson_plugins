	If there are problems retrieving the ClearCase history using lshistory, it is possible to
	specify the VOB paths in this field. Multiple VOB paths can be specified by separating them 
	by a whitespace. If one VOB path name contains whitespace, you can escape by writing the space 
	as '\ '. For example "foo\ bar zot" will specify two vob paths "foo bar" and "zot".
