<div>
    <b>Optional</b> &mdash; List of folders (one folder per line) to be actually
    downloaded from ClearCase.<br/>
    For this field to be taken into account, you need to check the <b>Use
    snapshot view</b> field.<br/>
    If no restrictions are defined, then all the data for the selected ClearCase
    UCM baseline will be downloaded. If restrictions are defined, then only
    these folders will be downloaded.<br/>
    For each folder to download, don't forget to prefix them with the VOB name
    and the component root dir (usually identical to the component name) this
    folder belongs to. For example, if you want to download the folder
    <code>05_impl/0_src</code> which is in the <code>fa4_web</code> component of
    the <code>fa4</code> VOB, set the value to <code>/fa/fa4_web/05_impl/0_src</code>.
