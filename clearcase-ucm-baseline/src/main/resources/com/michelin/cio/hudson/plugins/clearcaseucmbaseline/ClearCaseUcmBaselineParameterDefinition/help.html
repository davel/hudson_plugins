<div>
    When used, this parameter will display a field at build-time so that the
    user is able to select the ClearCase UCM baseline from which to download
    the content to be worked with by this project.<br/>
    To use this parameter, you MUST also set the SCM to be the ClearCase UCM
    baseline one, otherwise the build will fail.<br/>
    The name of the selected ClearCase UCM baseline is available through the
    <code>CLEARCASE_BASELINE</code> environment variable.
