<div>
  Mandatory. Specifies the path to the Java property file (key=value pairs), relative to
  <a href='ws/'>the workspace root</a>, that
  contains the data value for this data series.  The file must
  contain a <code>YVALUE</code> property and may optionally
  contain a <code>URL</code> property. If present, the URL will be 
  opened when the data point on the plot is clicked.
  <p>
  The specification of this file can use wildcards like <code>build/report/*/report.properties</code>
  but only the first file resolved by the wildcard will be used.
  See <a href='http://ant.apache.org/manual/CoreTypes/fileset.html'>
  the @includes of Ant fileset</a> for the exact format.
  <p>
  For example, a properties file might look like:
  <pre>
  YVALUE=3.342
  URL=http://foo.bar/
  </pre>
</div>
