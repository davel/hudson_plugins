<p>Hudson understands <a href="http://cppcheck.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Cppcheck</a>
analysis report XML format. When this option is configured Hudson shows
the Cppcheck analysis results in different views: historical result
trend, analysis reports.</p>
<p>You need to set up your build to run Cppcheck in order to use
this feature - this Hudson plug-in does not perform the actual analysis!
This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
