<p>Hudson understands the <a href="http://cppcheck.wiki.sourceforge.net/">Cppcheck</a> report XML format.
When this option is configured, Hudson can provide useful information about results in different views: historical result trend, analysis reports.</p>
<p>You need to set up your build to run Cppcheck in order to use
this feature - this Hudson plug-in does not perform the actual analysis!
This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
