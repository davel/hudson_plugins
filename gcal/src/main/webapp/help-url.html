  <p>
    The URL needed here is the private XML address.<br />
    To get this URL, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank">log</a> on to your google calendar, go to
    settings, select the calendar tab and click on the calendar you wish to use for your hudson job. Then click the
    XML button at the bottom of the page in the 'private' section. It should pop up a window with the address.<br />
    The address generated will contain a 'magic cookie' number that you'll want to strip out.<br/>
    The url will look like:<br/>
    http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/user%40gmail.com/private-9c22dffd59eaf9e5964e066f7ffff8f4/basic<br/>
    and you will need to make it look like :<br/>
    http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/user%40gmail.com/private/full<br/>
    To do so:<br/>
    1. strip out the 'magic cookie' number after /private-<br />
    2. replace /basic with /full<br />
