<div>
Enter the path to the archive containing your sounds.<p />
This path should either be a local filing system path, or an absolute http:// URL to a locally accessible web server.
Hudson streams the audio from the archive for each event (to reduce memory requirements), so make sure it's not too far away.<p/>
The default value is:<br />
<pre>    src/main/webapp/sound-archive.zip</pre>
The archive can be of .zip or .jar format. Hudson ignores the folder structure of the archive, so avoid adding sounds of the same name.
