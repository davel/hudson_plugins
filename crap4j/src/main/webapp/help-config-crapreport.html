	<p><b>XML Crap Report filename pattern</b><br/>
	  This filename pattern is used to find the crap4j report XML file, which will be created
	  alongside your HTML report files.<br/>
	  The pattern is specified in the Ant glob syntax, such as **/target/crap4j/report.xml. The basedir is the project workspace.
	  <br/>Be sure not to include any
      non-report files into this pattern.
