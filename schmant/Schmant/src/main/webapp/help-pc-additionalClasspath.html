  <p>Paths to additional <i>Jar files</i> that will be added to the classpath
  that is used when running Schmant. Different file paths should be separated by
  the operating system's path separator (':' on Unix, ';' on Windows). Relative

  to Schmant's classpath, if the script language is not installed in the running
