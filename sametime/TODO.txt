Short term tasks:

- Add better logging.
- Provide help-html fragments for the GUI
- Code cleanups

TODO

- Connect to Jabber-Plugin Author to maybe join efforts.  This code has been written with that in mind from the get-go, hence the use of the Jabber classes
- Full unit tests.  Sametime's API is almost exclusively "factory/abstract class", making it difficult to create mocks.  Using jMock was unsuccessful due to weird classpath errors in trying to find asm (which exists on my classpath).
