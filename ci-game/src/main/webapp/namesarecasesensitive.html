<div><p>The checkbox decides if the game should treat the user names in Hudson case sensitive or not.
    Hudson treats user names as case sensitive, which mean that user "John" is not the same user
    as "john". Some SCMs make it possible to login with the same user but with different casing,
    which means that to Hudson there are separate users. This introduces a problem in the game
    as one real user can have several Hudson users.</p>
  <p>If this checkbox is enabled, the game will treat all users as separate, just like Hudson does.
    If this checkbox is disabled, the game will make case insensitive look ups of the user names
    which mean points awarded to "John" and "john" will be awarded to the same user.</p>
