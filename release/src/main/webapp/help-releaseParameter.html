<div>
    Defines a simple text parameter, where users can enter a string value,
    which you can use during a build, either as an environment variable, or
    through variable substitution in some other parts of the configuration.
    <p/>
    This is functionally the same as a standard String parameter except that
    the release plugin recognizes this parameter and will use it to set the
    version in the build description.
