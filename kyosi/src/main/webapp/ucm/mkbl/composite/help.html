	ClearCase UCM Make baseline composite will create a composite baseline for succesful build of the last product job. 
	The name of the compoiste baseline will be derived from the name pattern below (might not be that name exactly since Clearcase might use template for naming baselines). 
	An environment variable, ${CC_BASELINE_NAME}, is created containing the actual name of the created baseline and is available during build. 
	The baseline will be promoted to BUILT.
