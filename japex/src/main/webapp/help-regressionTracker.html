    When Hudson records Japex report file, it can check that against the report in the previous run,
    and if there is enough performance difference, it will send out an e-mail. This is an useful
    mechanism to catch performance regressions.
    Choosing the right threshold value usually requires that you run the test for a few times
    and find out the normal deviation between different runs.
