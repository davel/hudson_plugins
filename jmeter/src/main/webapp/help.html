<div>This plugin understands the <a
	href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a> analysis report XML
format. This plug-in does not perform the actual analysis; it only
displays useful information about analysis results, such as average
responding time, historical result trend, web UI for viewing analysis
reports, and so on.

<p>To use this feature, first set up your build to run tests, then
specify the path to JMeter XML file, such as <tt>jmeter-results.jtl</tt>.</p>
