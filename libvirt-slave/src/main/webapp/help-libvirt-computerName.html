        Here you can find all configured machine in your hypervisor.<br/>
        If you have an empty combo, maybe there is problem with the hypervisor connection.

        Communication with hypervisor is done using ssh tunnel and you need to put hudson user key in known_keys inside hypervisor ssh folder.
