    <b>Expose P4PASSWD in environment</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When this box is checked hudson will add the P4PASSWD
    environment value to the process environment. This can
    help scripts that need to perform Perforce command operations
    succeed. If tickets are used the value will be replaced by the
    value of the ticket used during the plugin execution.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp;This is a serious security risk if environment values
    are printed in log files and you should consider alternative ways for
    providing the credentials to command line tools that need them.
