	In order for slaves to sync correctly, a different client workspace needs to be used for each. This box configures the client name that is used for the slaves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supported tokens are:
<ul>
<li>${basename} - The client name as configured in the above section</li>
<li>${hostname} - The hostname of the slave</li>
<li>${hash} - The hash code of the slave name</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  <p>The recommended default value is "${basename}-${hash}" (without quotes).</p>
</div>
