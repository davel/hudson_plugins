	Normally, Hudson will update the client workspace Root and Host fields regardless of whether or not "Let hudson manage workpace view" is checked. This is because syncing will likely not work properly if these two fields aren't changed. This option disables this functionality, and treats the client spec as 'sacred'. No changes will ever be made to the client spec.

    If you do not want the plugin to update the client workspace spec,
    then check this box.

  <p><b>Important Note:</b> If you check this option, the plugin may not sync the workspace properly. Only check it if you absolutely know what you are doing!
