    Perforce tracks changes for each workspace specification on the server, and this
    is how it knows which files to update during a p4 sync.  This means that
    each physical workspace needs to have its own workspace specification to
    track it's own files.  To ensure a unique workspaces for each project
    across all the slaves we append the hostname of the slave to the end of the
    workspace name given in the "Workspace (client)" field.

    If you do not want the plugin to automatically rename clients for each slave
    then check this box.
