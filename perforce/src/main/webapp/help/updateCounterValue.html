    <b>Update counter to most recent changeset</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When this box is checked hudson uses the value of the most
    recent changeset to update the value of the counter instead
    of using the current counter value to sync. This is provided
    to facilitate downstream jobs which need to sync to the same
    changeset as this job. This feature is an alternative to
    using a P4 label when multiple builds must share a common set
    of changes.
