	Perforce translates line endings when syncing and submitting files. The <i>LineEnd:</i> option in the perforce client spec is used to override the default behavior to make perforce use a specific type of line ending when syncing and sumbitting files.
<ul>
<li><b>local</b> Use the same line endings as the system being used to sync. This is the recommended default.</li>
<li><b>unix</b> Use unix style line endings (LF)</li>
<li><b>mac</b> Use mac style line endings (CR)</li>
<li><b>win</b> Use Windows style line endings (CRLF)</li>
<li><b>share</b> Sync using unix line endings, but submit using either unix or windows line endings (for environments shared between operating systems)</li>
</ul>
