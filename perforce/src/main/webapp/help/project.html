  <p>
    <b>Workspace (client)</b>: Workspace or Clientspec (oldskewl) of the project. If the workspace
    specified does not exist, Hudson will create it. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: Hudson will likely change the root of this workspace to fit Hudson's
    installation.  That means Hudson also automatically creates a workspace for each slave on every
    project.  The hostname of the slave is appended to the end of the given workspace name to ensure
    that all workspaces are unique and don't collide across machines. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: If two jobs retrieve the same file into their workspace, these jobs must
    use a unique Perforce workspace. The reason is otherwise the p4 server will lose track of the actual
    contents of the workspaces, leading to inaccurate workspace file versions.  For example, if job1
    and job2 use the same Perforce workspace, and both include file1, when the file1 is changed, a
    Perforce 'get latest' will only retrieve file1 into the first job (e.g. job1) that builds, it will
    not be retrieved into job2 unless you do a 'One Time Force Sync'.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: When Hudson creates a workspace, the workspace will contain only one
    view.  This view maps the Depot Path to the root of the Hudson job's workspace directory.  If Hudson
    uses an existing workspace that has only one view, it automatically changes the view in a similar
    way.  This behavior can be disabled by the option, "Let Hudson Manage Workspace View.  This will
    allow you to retrieve more than one depot into the workspace of a given job by providing your own
    list of views.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Let Hudson Manage Workspace View</b>: For most cases, leave this checked.  Hudson will update
    the workspace's view to match the project's settings.  If you uncheck it, you must manage the
    workspace's view yourself.  This is useful if, for this job, you need to checkout and build multiple
    projects from Perforce at once.  (For those managing the workspace view themselves and looking for a
    starting point, the typical hudson view is: '//depot/[PROJECTNAME]/... //[WORKSPACENAME]/...'
    You'll notice this is slightly different from typical workspaces.  The [PROJECTNAME] is not normally
    included.)
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Views</b>: This is the depot to client mapping in the same format as a standard perforce workspace spec
    If "Let Hudson Manage Workspace View" is checked the view entered here will overwrite anything
    in the existing client
  </p>
  <p>
    Typical Example:<br>
    //depot/folder1/... //workspace-name/folder1/...<br>
    //depot/folder2/... //workspace-name/folder2/...<br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Options</b><br/>
      Original setting is <i>noallwrite noclobber nocompress unlocked nomodtime normdir.</i><br>
      Default is <i>noallwrite clobber compress unlocked nomodtime rmdir.</i><br>
      The main differences between original setup: clobber files will owerride, empty directories will be remove, and
      data transfer will be compressed.

  </p>
  <p>
    <b>One Time Force Sync</b>: allows you to tell perforce to do a p4 sync -f //... which will make sure to
    pull down ALL files to the workspace, regardless if they have been sync'd before.  Use this to get around
    a problem where the Perforce workspace became out of sync with what hudson actually has a copy of.  For
    most users, you should never need to worry about this.
  </p>
  <p>Note: this is reset after the next subsequent build.</p>
  <p>
    <b>First Changelist to Track</b>: allows you to specify the first changelist to start recording build
    history from.  If you are adding an existing project, with lots of history, to Hudson, this will
    prevent out of memory errors and your first build from having thousands of change records.
