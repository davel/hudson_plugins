  <p><b>Views</b><br/>
    This is the depot to client mapping in the same format as a standard perforce workspace spec
    If "Let Hudson Manage Workspace View" is checked the view entered here will overwrite anything
    in the existing client
  </p>
  <p>
    Typical Example:<br>
    //depot/folder1/... //workspace-name/folder1/...<br>
    //depot/folder2/... //workspace-name/folder2/...<br>
	  <br>
  </p>

  <b>One Time Force Sync</b> allows you to tell perforce to do a p4 sync -f //... which will make sure to
  pull down ALL files to the workspace, regardless if they have been sync'd before.  Use this to get around
  a problem where the Perforce workspace became out of sync with what hudson actually has a copy of.  For
  most users, you should never need to worry about this.
  </p>
  <p>Note: this is reset after the next subsequent build.</p>
  <p>
  <b>First Changelist to Track</b> allows you to specify the first changelist to start recording build
  history from.  If you are adding an existing project, with lots of history, to Hudson, this will 
  prevent out of memory errors and your first build from having thousands of change records.
