    Sync to a perforce counter value instead of a changeset
  </p>
  <p>
    If a counter is entered here the plugin will sync to the counter value
    instead of the most recent changeset. This feature can be used for
    downstream jobs where the upstream job has checked the box below to
    update the value of the counter instead of using it to sync.
