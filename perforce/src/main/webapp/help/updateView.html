    <b>Let Hudson Manage Workspace View</b>: For most cases, leave this checked.  Hudson will overwrite
    the workspace's view to match the project's settings provided below.
  </p>
  <p>
    If unchecked, you must manage the workspace's view yourself.  This is useful if, for this
    job, you need to checkout and build multiple projects from Perforce at once.  (For those
    managing the workspace view themselves and looking for a starting point, the typical hudson
    view is: '//depot/[PROJECTNAME]/... //[WORKSPACENAME]/...'  You'll notice this is slightly
    different from typical workspaces.  The [PROJECTNAME] is not normally included.)
