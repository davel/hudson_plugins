    <b>Workspace (client)</b>: Workspace or Clientspec (oldskewl) of the project. If the workspace
    specified does not exist, Hudson will create it. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: Hudson will likely change the root of this workspace to fit Hudson's
    installation.  That means Hudson also automatically creates a workspace for each slave on every
    project.  The hostname of the slave is appended to the end of the given workspace name to ensure
    that all workspaces are unique and don't collide across machines. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: If two jobs retrieve the same file into their workspace, these jobs must
    use a unique Perforce workspace. The reason is otherwise the Perforce server will lose track of the actual
    contents of the workspaces, leading to inaccurate workspace file versions.  For example, if job1
    and job2 use the same Perforce workspace, and both include file1, when the file1 is changed, a
    Perforce 'get latest' will only retrieve file1 into the first job (e.g. job1) that builds, it will
    not be retrieved into job2 unless you do a 'One Time Force Sync'.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: When Hudson creates a workspace, the workspace will contain only one
    view.  This view maps the Depot Path to the root of the Hudson job's workspace directory.  If Hudson
    uses an existing workspace that has only one view, it automatically changes the view in a similar
    way.  This behavior can be disabled by the option, "Let Hudson Manage Workspace View.  This will
    allow you to retrieve more than one depot into the workspace of a given job by providing your own
    list of views.
