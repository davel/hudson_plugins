    For <b>Windows</b> host OS only.<br>
    SystemRoot and SystemDrive are needed in order for the P4 client to resolve hostnames.
    Why? I have no idea. Send questions to Bill.Gates@microsoft.com

    If you are seeing messages in your log that look like: "Connect to server failed; check $P4PORT"
    and your P4PORT setting above is correct, then likely you do not these two fields set correctly.

     Example:<br>
     <b>System Drive:</b> C:<br>
     <b>System Root:</b> C:\\WINDOWS<Br>
