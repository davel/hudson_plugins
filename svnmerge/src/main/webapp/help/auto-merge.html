    This option is used in conjunction with the "Enable Subversion Merge Tracking" option
    (which appears early in the configuration.)

    <p>
    When this option is set, Hudson will automatically integrate a succesful build to
    the upstream Subversion branch via "svn merge". Failure to do so results in a build failure
    (for example, when a conflict is discovered during a merge.)

    <p>
    This feature allows you to use a Subversion branch as a gate keeper. Instead of
    committing directly to the upstream, you commit to your branch, and let Hudson
    auto-commit that to the upstream after making sure that the branch builds.
