    When this option is checked, this project will be equipped with UI
    for creating "feature branches", which are branches
    for changes eventually targeted for integration into this project, and
    accepting changes from such feature branches
    (by means of <tt>svn merge</tt> in Subversion 1.5.)

    <p>
    Hudson allows automated and/or manually-triggered
    integrations, tracking around what changes
    from which feature branches are integrated when, and other useful data collection
    around this.

    <p>
    This mechanism is useful for keeping a large project stable, because the trunk
    of the development is shielded from problems in feature branches, and integration
    can be done much later after a build, after you qualified it through testing.
