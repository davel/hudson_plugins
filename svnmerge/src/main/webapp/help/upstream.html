    Enable Subversion merge tracking between this branch and its upstream branch,
    so that you can do controlled integrations of changes with reduced risk
    of instability in the upstream.

    <p>
    A typical use case of this is when you are working on a "feature" that has
    a bigger risk of instability. In such a case, committing directly to the trunk
    could result in blocking other developers. In such a case, you can create
    a branch in Subversion, set up a job on Hudson on that branch, and check this
    option.

    <p>
    You can then either:

    <ul>
    <li>
        Automatically integrate the branch back to the trunk when
        a certin condition is met, such as when a build is successful,
        or when a build is promoted (with the promoted-build plugin),
        etc.
    <li>
        Tell Hudson to integrate a build of your choice to the trunk.
    </ul>

    <p>
    Merge can be done repeatedly and bidirectionally
    (that is, you can merge between the trunk and the branch back and forth
    as many times as you need, so that the branch can follow the trunk closely)

    <p>
    This feature requires Subversion 1.5 on the server.
