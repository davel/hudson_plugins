	 Instead of specifying the buckminster commands directly in the job configuration,
	 you can also use a textfile that contains the buckminster commands.</br>
	 The path of the script file is relative to the job's workspace.

	    Note that any commands you entered into the text area above will not be
	    executed if you specify a script file
