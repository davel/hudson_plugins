 Archives the build target platform and publish it under the given name. Archived files will be accessible from the Hudson webpage and jobs that use a buckminster build step are able to select from a list of all published target platforms.
Normally, Hudson keeps artifacts for a build as long as a build log itself is kept, but if you don't need old artifacts and would rather save disk space, you can do so.
